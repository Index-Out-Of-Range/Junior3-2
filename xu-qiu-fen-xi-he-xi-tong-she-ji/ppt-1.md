## Model
#### Definition: 
* the intermediate descriptions (documents) produced in the process.
> 过程中产生的中间描述（文件）。

#### Features: 
* Abstract view of a system.
* Easy to understand.
* A valuable means for communication.

#### Relationship between analysis models and design models
* analysis models → design models
* What if different languages are used for the two phases?
> Information can not be accurately translated.
* **OO technology**: use the same kinds of models in the two phases.
    * The analysis models will be preserved and recognized in the design phase.
    > 分析模型将在设计阶段得到保留和认可。
    * Design phase: just adding some details.Thus, the course only covers the design phase.
    > 设计阶段：只需添加一些细节。 因此，该课程仅涵盖设计阶段。

    > 符号：数据流图
* Object-oriented methods
    * Models: to be covered in Chapter 2
    * Notations
    > Unified Modeling Language (UML)
    
#### A brief Introduction to UML

## Outline
* Use-case Diagram
    * Actors
    * A use-case should be abstract
    * Generalization,Specialization
    * Inclusion, Extension
* Sequence Diagram
    * First step of designing(设计的第一步)
    * An example
    * Components of a sequence diagram
    * Collaboration diagram
    * Conditional/asynchronous message,etc

## Introduction to Use-case Diagram
* Role played(作用)
    * Initial statement of the requirements.（需求的初始陈述。）
    * As detailed as you can.
    * External visible behavior of the system.（系统的外部可见行为）
* Components
    * Actors: the roles that users can play
    * Use case: the interaction between actors and the system
    
> 用例：要实现某个功能的总体性的描述，针对最终结果即可，如保存文档。不用考虑途径和异常

#### Actors
* Usually: different groups of users
* No one-to-one correspondence between a single user and an actor
> 单个用户和参与者之间没有一对一的通信
* Not necessarily be human 
    * Human
    * Computer systems
    * Some devices

#### Use case
* Should be **abstract**
    * Not every piece of operation can be viewed as a use case
    * Exceptions can NOT be viewed as separate use cases.
* **Definition**:a description of a whole class of interactions that have the same overall intention. 
> 对具有相同总体意图的整个交互类的描述。
* Consists of
    * A basic course of events
    * Alternative courses
    * Exceptional courses
